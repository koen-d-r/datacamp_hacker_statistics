This is a Datacamp project from the Intermediate Python for Data Science course

In this Datacamp project we are simulating a game with dice. Below you can find the rules:
- Let's assume we are on the Empire State Building
- Every round we roll a dice
- When rolled is 1 or 2, one step down has to be taken
- When rolled 3, 4 or 5, one step up can be taken
- When rolled 6, another roll determines your steps up
- With every role of dice, there is a chance of 0.01% that you will fall down the stairs to the ground floor
- One game consists of 100 dice rolls

We will simulate the game above 250 times to calculate in how many cases step 60 or higher in the Empire State Building is reached!
